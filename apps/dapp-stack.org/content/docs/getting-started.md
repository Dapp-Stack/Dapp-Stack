## Learn DApp Stack

People come to DApp Stack from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you'll find this section helpful.

* If you prefer to **learn by doing**, start with our [practical tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial.html).
* If you prefer to **learn concepts step by step**, start with our [guide to main concepts](/docs/environments.html).

Like any unfamiliar technology, DApp Stack does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you *will* get the hang of it.

### First Examples

The [DApp Stack](/) contains a few small examples. Even if you don't know anything about DApp Stack yet, try them and see the results.

### DApp Stack for Beginners

If you feel that the DApp Stack documentation goes at a faster pace than you're comfortable with, check out [the official website](https://www.ethereum.org). It introduces the most important Ethereum concepts in a detailed. Once you're done, give the documentation another try!

### DApp Stack Resources

The DApp Stack documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don't have to be an expert, but it's harder to learn both DApp Stack and JavaScript at the same time.

We recommend going through [this JavaScript overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React.

>Tip
>
>Whenever you get confused by something in JavaScript, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [javascript.info](http://javascript.info/) are great websites to check.

We also assume some knowloedge with Solidity. We recommend going through [this Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Practical Tutorial

If you prefer to **learn by doing,** check out our [practical tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial.html). In this tutorial, we build a simple store. You might be tempted to skip it -- but give it a chance. The techniques you'll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building *any* DApp, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding.

### Step-by-Step Guide

If you prefer to **learn concepts step by step,** our [guide to main concepts](/docs/environments.html) is the best place to start. Every next chapter in it builds on the knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so you won't miss anything as you go along.


### Advanced Concepts

Once you're comfortable with the [main concepts](#/docs/environments.html) and played with DApp Stack a little bit, you might be interested in more advanced topics. This section will introduce you to the powerful, but less commonly used DApp Stack features.


## Staying Informed

The [DApp Stack blog](/blog/) is the official source for the updates from the DApp Stack team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted there first.

You can also follow the [@dapp_stack account](https://twitter.com/dapp_stack) on Twitter, but you won't miss anything essential if you only read the blog.

Not every DApp Stack release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release [in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the DApp Stack repository](https://github.com/Dapp-Stack/Dapp-Stack/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), as well as on the [Releases](https://github.com/Dapp-Stack/Dapp-Stack) page.

## Versioned Documentation

This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of DApp Stack. You can find older versions of the documentation [on a separate page](/versions). Note that documentation for past versions is snapshotted at the time of the release, and isn't being continuously updated.

## Something Missing?

If something is missing in the documentation or if you found some part confusing, please [file an issue for the documentation repository](https://github.com/Dapp-Stack/Dapp-Stack/issues/new) with your suggestions for improvement, or tweet at the [@dapp_stack account](https://twitter.com/dapp_stack). We love hearing from you!
