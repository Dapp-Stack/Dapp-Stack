Hello Everyone,

We are glad to introduce you to DApp Stack, with DApp Stack you will be able to develop your DApp
with real ease.

There is already quite a few framework out there, for example, [embark](https://embark.status.im) or [truffle](https://truffleframework.com).

However, we think that there is a room for another point of view. If you look at the web pipeline for example, embark is all in and include everything you need, truffle on the other side do not include anything.

We have decided to position ourself in the middle where you can decide which framework you like and we will integrate with it.

This is only one of many example, and in general we really favour simplicity and ease.

Let's proof it and run a DApp in few minutes, just run the following command:

```bash
mkdir my-dapp
cd my-dapp
npx create-dapp-stack
npm install
npm run das start
```

That's it! You have a DApp running and you already deployed a Smart Contract to your local node.

There is a lot more, feel free to have a look to the [full documentation](/docs/getting-started.html) or the [tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial.html)

Also this is only the V0.4.0 and as such the beginning of our journey, you can have a look to our [issues](https://github.com/Dapp-Stack/Dapp-Stack/issues) to see what's next or even open one if you encounter any problem.

Finally DApp Stack is open source and welcome any contribution, have a look at our [contributing guide](/docs/how-to-contribute.html), we are looking forward to see your PR's.

We hope you will enjoy using DApp Stack has much as we enjoy developing it.

John Solon.
